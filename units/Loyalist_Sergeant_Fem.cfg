    description= _ "Isolde was a squire to her husband, Sir Johan, a brave knight who had spent his life on campaigns and done many deeds for the glory of the Vesnotian Crown. He fought in Eldred's army at the Battle of Abez's Crossing and defeated many orcs and trolls. When the rebellion began, Johan had no time to realise what had happened and was ignominiously killed by an arrow from Garard's supporters. 

During their time together, Johan taught Isolde many military tricks. Now she fights in the Asheviere army to confirm her knighthood. Though Isolde is inferior to the other commanders in nobility of background as well as physical strength, she endeavours to be a proactive and brave soldier, and will undoubtedly achieve more if she survives."
