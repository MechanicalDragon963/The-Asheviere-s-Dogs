            story=_ "While Bazur and Isolde had been fighting their way towards Tath, Asheviere had launched a massive recruitment effort at Wesnoth’s northern border. Soradoc was brought under the Crown’s direct control, and transformed into a rallying point for orcish mercenaries. One by one, warriors and warlords flocked there and swore allegiance in return for coin."

            story=_ "Asheviere was well aware that she was calling down a storm — she had seen that orcish loyalty was measured only in gold; that chieftains often attacked each other and the royal army, or stooped to plundering. But the Queen needed soldiers who cared nothing for the ideals of Wesnoth’s rebels; soldiers happy to support any cause so long as they were paid. Plundered villages were a fair price to pay for future years of prosperity under her rule."

        [part]
            story=_ "Shocked by how low Asheviere had stooped, the remaining disorganized, scattered eastern rebels around Soradoc fell quickly to the sudden influx of orcs. At the same time, the western provinces — particularly Elensefar — had no desire to be involved in another war so soon after Garard’s, a view only encouraged by the imposing, heavily-guarded royal fortress at Halstead."

            story=_ "Only the mighty baron of Dan-Tonk, Richard de Ferres, remained a credible threat to Asheviere’s rule. Even before Bazur and Isolde had reached Tath, de Ferres and his allies had already arrived at Weldyn."

            story=_ "Asheviere made battle against them in the fields outside the capital, fearing that a city siege might drive townsfolk to defect. Her right-hand man was the warlord Ghuvog, high chief of the Blackcrests and once-ally of Eldred’s."
